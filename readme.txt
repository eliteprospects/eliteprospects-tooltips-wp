Informative tooltips for links to Eliteprospects.com profile pages

== Description ==

This plugin will add a tooltip to all Eliteprospects.com profile page links, like players and staff, on your page.

A single script is added to the footer of your pages so your theme need to have the wp_footer() template tag in the appropriate place.

To create links you can use this plugin:
